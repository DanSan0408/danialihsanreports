# Reflective Assignments

## Assignment 1

This industrial talk has explained the roles of every job at a fintech company, providing me with knowledge about various aspects of ICT jobs and their responsibilities, which I previously didn’t understand or know. With my limited knowledge and inexperience in the field, I was initially unsure about the different applications used to operate certain roles in the workforce, such as UI/UX developer. Working in ICT requires many skills and soft skills to be utilized during and after the app development process. There are numerous jobs and responsibilities that a person holds when working in the ICT field. Therefore, I’m planning to further my research in the ICT work field to prepare myself for future challenges.

## Assignment 2

Reflecting on the talk, it significantly enhanced our knowledge of Technology Information Systems, aiding in our understanding of our course material at UTM. The talk particularly expanded our understanding of networking and how information systems function, including their implementation at UTM. We managed to relate the knowledge gained from this talk to our course material effectively. I hope that more talks like this can be held in the future as they provide substantial benefits and knowledge to us, the students.

## Assignment 3

This talk broadened my perspective on the diverse career opportunities in the analytics sector, emphasizing the importance of understanding one's strengths and weaknesses, even when pursuing the same career path, as each sub-career within analytics is significantly different. The visit was informative, shedding light on the tasks of different jobs, team dynamics crucial for project success, tools used in the process, and more. It provided valuable experience and knowledge for students to gain a deeper understanding. Previously, I underestimated the field of data engineering, thinking it primarily involved data collection and analysis. However, I now see its extensive applications across various fields and its relevance to real-life situations.

## Assignment 4

During my industrial visit to the Indah Water Research Consortium, I learned many new things, especially about the sewage system in our country. Previously, I assumed that toilet sewage went directly into the ocean. However, after the visit, I fully understood the wastewater treatment process necessary to prevent the spread of diseases in the community. Sewerage is a critical system in every country, often overlooked. Through collective contributions, we can maintain and improve our sewerage systems to ensure cleanliness in our daily lives.

## Assignment 5: PC Assembly

Reflecting on this assignment, I gained substantial knowledge about computers that I hadn't encountered before. Exploring the inner workings of a computer and learning how to assemble and disassemble one provided me with valuable skills and experiences. I'm grateful for this assignment as it introduced me to new knowledge and helped me acquire essential skills for the future.

## Assignment 6: GitHub

This assignment introduced me to the GitHub platform, which I hadn't used before. I was impressed by its capabilities and found it to be a valuable tool for gaining knowledge and experience in various aspects.
